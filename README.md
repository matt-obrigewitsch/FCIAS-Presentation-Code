# FCIAS-Presentation-Code
Example code to show to FCIAS

This repository includes three different pieces of work meant to showcase my ability.

The first is hub.py, a short python script from a larger project. This project was an out of the box (and over the top) solution to my Grade 12 assignment
of creating an RPG game. This code takes a picture of a map, and creates a transversable game out of it based on prewritten events, which were uniquely easy to add.
This was done through creating, then indexing and spliting a multidimentional array. This project displays my ability to think up effeciant outside of the box solutions.

The second is assignment2.css, a c++ assignment made during my recent University semester. This code isn't entirely impressive, but showcases my ability to write clean
and refined code. 

The third and final piece of work is BattleManager.py, a personal c# project I have been writing in my free time. This code is a part of a group of around 15 other scripts used
in the project, and refrences them many times. Additionally, it was entirely for fun and was never inteneded to be read by anyone but myself, and as a result it is messy, 
unrefined, and next to uncommented. I included it to show that I have a passion for this, and I am dedicated to improving my skills during my free time.
